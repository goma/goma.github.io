<h3>What Does Goma 6.0 Do?</h3>
<p>Goma 6.0 is software for numerical simulation of multiphysics continuum
processes, including moving geometry, phase-change, fluid-structural interactions,
complex rheology, and chemical reactions. It solves the fundamental equations of
mass, momentum, energy, and chemical species transport using the finite-element
method</p>
<h3>How Does Goma 6.0 Work?</h3>
<p>Goma 6.0 solves problems from all branches of mechanics, including fluid
mechanics, solid mechanics, chemical reactions and mass transport, and energy
transport. The conservation principles for momentum, mass, species, and
energy, together with material constitutive relations, can be described by partial
differential equations. The equations are made discrete for solution on a digital
computer with the finite element method in space and the finite difference
method in time. The resulting nonlinear, time-dependent, algebraic equations
are solved with a full Newton-Raphson method. The linearized equations are
solved with direct or Krylov-based iterative solvers. The simulations can be
run on a single processor or on multiple processors in parallel using domain
decomposition, which can greatly speed up engineering analysis</p>
<p>Goma is designed as a general mechanics code, with no features that tie it
to any particular application. Applications, or problems to be solved, are
specified completely in input files, which include code and material properties
specifications. The multitude of differential equations, material constitutive
equations, and boundary conditions has evolved with the applications, but they
are all from theories fully published in the open literature and Goma’s theory
manual.</p>
<p>Although many of Goma’s applications involve fixed boundaries, Goma really
stands out when applied to problems with dynamic geometries, i.e. free and
moving boundaries. A novel algorithm for mesh motion is at the heart of Goma,
where boundary motion is accommodated by allowing mesh nodes to move as
if they were a pseudo-solid rubbery material. This is where Goma gets its name,
which means “rubber elasticity” in Spanish. From the principles of kinematics, this
algorithm can be applied to either fluid- or solid-material regions or to problems
of fluid-structure interactions. The problem can be Lagrangian, meaning that the
mesh moves with the material, or Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian, meaning that in
some places the mesh moves with the material and in others it does not. Goma 6.0
also includes purely Eulerian boundary tracking methods on stationary meshes,
using either the level set or the overset-grid methods.</p>
