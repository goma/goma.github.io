    <h2>What is Goma?</h2>
    <p id="p1">Goma is an open-source, parallel, and scalable multiphysics software package
    for modeling and simulation of physical processes. It solves
    problems in all branches of mechanics, including fluids, solids, and thermal
    analysis. Goma employs advanced numerical methods for solving problem with coupled phenomena for manufacturing and performance
    applications. It also provides a flexible software development environment for
    specialty physics. Goma is being used to reduce process-development time,
    understand fundamental processes, and to educate the next generation of
    computational mechanics experts.</p>

    <h2>Purpose and Future Goals</h2>
    <p>Goma has an unique feature for those who need to add new physics,
    equations, and material models to evaluate their process or product. Unlike
    commercial codes, Goma’s source code is available allowing easy exploration of
    new algorithms, physics, and verification. Additionally, Goma takes advantage
    of parallel processing architectures without extra licensing fees assessed per
    processor, which is often standard practice in commercial codes. Through open
    sourcing Goma, we plan to help create the next-generation of computational mechanics experts through
    a hands-on development process</p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>  
    <p>Goma has been applied to manufacturing process design and device performance
    within the national laboratory system and in industry.Goma's applications range from
    coating and drying, to polymer processing and joining processes.
    Specific examples include flat-panel glass processing at Corning, composites such as 3M®
    Aluminum Conductor Composite Reinforced materials for power lines, and porous adsorbent
    media applications at Procter &amp; Gamble. </p>
