    <h2>What is Goma 6.0?</h2>
    <p id="p1">Goma 6.0 is an open-source, parallel, and scalable multiphysics software package
    for modeling and simulation of real-life physical processes, with a basis in
    computational fluid dynamics for problems with evolving geometry. It solves
    problems in all branches of mechanics, including fluids, solids, and thermal
    analysis. Goma 6.0 uses advanced numerical methods, focusing on the low-speed
    flow regime with coupled phenomena for manufacturing and performance
    applications. It also provides a flexible software development environment for
    specialty physics. Goma 6.0 is being used to reduce process-development time,
    understand fundamental processes, and to educate the next generation of
    computational mechanics experts.</p>

    <h2>Purpose and Future Goals</h2>
    <p>Goma 6.0 serves a niche market for those who need to add new physics,
    equations, and material models to evaluate their process or product. Unlike
    commercial codes, Goma’s source code is available allowing easy exploration of
    new algorithms, physics, and verification. Additionally, Goma takes advantage
    of parallel processing architectures without extra licensing fees assessed per
    processor, which is often standard practice in commercial codes. Through open
    sourcing Goma, we plan to help create the next-generation of CFD experts through
    a hands-on development process</p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>  
    <p>Goma 6.0 has been applied to manufacturing process design and deviceperformance
    within the national laboratory system and in industry. Specific
    examples include flat-panel glass processing at Corning, composites such as 3M®
    Aluminum Conductor Composite Reinforced materials for power lines, and porousadsorbent
    media applications at Procter &amp; Gamble. At SNL, applications range
    from coating and drying, to polymer processing and joining processes</p>
