  <h1>Goma and Goma TPL build instructions</h1>

  <p>11/03/2012 – Abishek</p>

  <p>1/25/2013 – P. R. Schunk, revised</p>

  <p>These notes are from recent build experiences on Red Hat RHEL5 and Red Hat RHEL6 OS.     Although many of the tips might apply to other platforms, there are no promises.   </p>

  <p>I have created this document/note to help users go through the GOMA build process without too many issues. I have added notes from ACCESS.distribution and GOMA_howto files in here. </p>

  <p>Basically, you first need to acquire the GOMA software distribution by one of several means.    The required libraries, or TPLs, are numerous.    If you have no root access, and you want to build a self-contained distribution from which GOMA and all its dependencies can be built, your directories and files will look like this in your “GOMA_ROOT” area:</p>

  </code></pre></div>
  <p>If you don’t have root access, and your machine has on it cmake and openmpi, then you will not need
    these libraries. Cmake is rarer than openmpi, but in any case you want to determine whether you
    have these. Cmake is used to build trilinos, and you can get it from the web (free downloads). Openmpi
    is required for all packages if you are to build for parallel capability. We suggest you just build this way
    and not worry about a serial version. In the case shown here, we didn’t have root access and and the
    machine did not have openmpi or cmake, so we acquired them, built them, and installed them in this
    GOMA_ROOT area.</p>

  <p>If you have root access, and you are building on a server of some sort, you may want to acquire Cmake
    and Openmpi and build and install in the usual default locations, like /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib etc., or
    even in /usr/bin for the executables. You may also have a shared area to build these tools in. You can
    also just simply work with your administrator to acquire these packages.</p>

  <p>The files “about<em>libraries”, “Goma</em>howto.txt”, “Readme.libs” are information files that are helpful to
    read. These are constantly being updated. These files can be obtained from the authors of this memo.
    Just email them. The files “Makefile, make.inc, make_output” are global makefiles to guide the
    building of their entire distribution in one command. As of this writing, it kindof works. We did have
    some trouble with trilinos. When we ship you a distribution, these makefiles and the goma source will
    be shipped along with some of the harder-to-get TPLs. This document instructs you how to get the rest.</p>

  <p>The supporting libraries for GOMA and in turn their dependencies can be seen in the Makefile here:</p>
  <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">
	# Target Dependencies:
	# Set the default target for the makefile:
	DEFAULT_TARGET = all
	# arpack dependent libraries
	ARPACK_DEPENDENCIES = blas lapack
	# arpack targets for make
	ARPACK_MAKE_TARGETS = all
	# front targets for make
	FRONT_TARGET = $(MACH_LOWERCASE)_mpi
	# trilinos dependent libraries
	TRILINOS_DEPENDENCIES = y12m parmetis superludist umfpack
	# trilinos configure/cmake file:
	TRILINOS_CONF_FILE = $(MACH_LOWERCASE)-goma-$(SERPAR_LOWERCASE)-cmake
  </code></pre></div>
  <p>“Key-linux-mpi-cmake-script” is for building trilinos, which we will discuss below.</p>

  <p>Finally, the remaining directories (distributions) are the required TPLs (third-party libraries). A brief
    description of each and how acquired is given here (but unless otherwise noted you may just want to
    contact Randy Schunk and get a copy from him, as in some rare cases we changed some things in each
    to make them compatible with the overall make file).</p>

  <p><code>BLAS</code>: You can get this from the internet. Open source. Easy to build. However, if you get a copy
    from us we have already made the changes in it to make the compilers compatible.</p>

  <p><code>ARPACK</code>: Arnoldi Solver package. Google it. Again, you can also start with what we supply.</p>

  <p><code>SEACAS-2012-09-10</code>: Please get this from source-forge. Sandia Analysis Package with all
    sorts of pre- and post-processing capabilities and the all important, and required exodus II
    database libraries. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/seacas">http://sourceforge.net/projects/seacas</a> You will also need netcdf and hdf5
    packages for this but that is discussed below.</p>

  <p><code>front</code>: please get this from Sandia. Frontal solver that is rarely used now.</p>

  <p><code>Sparse</code>: sparse 1.3. You can get this from the web, but also from Sandia. Another direct solver that is
    very robust and stable, but slow. Rarely used but important to have.</p>

  <p><code>SuperLU_DIST_2.3</code>: Parallel direct solver. Important package. Acquire from the web.</p>

  <p><code>trilinos-10.10.2-Source</code>: Google trilinos and this download option will be obvious.
    Please acquire this from the web. You will modify a provided script to build it. Trilinos is an
    essential collection of matrix solvers and other capabilities GOMA needs.</p>

  <p><code>lapack-3.2.1</code>: LAPACK is an optimized linear algebra package that trilinos packages
    depend upon. Get from Sandia.</p>

  <p><code>UMFPACK-5.4</code>: UMFPACK is the most often used direct solver. Probably need to acquire this
    from Sandia as of now as we have changes the build slightly.</p>

  <p><code>ParMetis-3.1.1</code>: Parallel graph partitioning library. Certain packages in Trilinos require
    this.</p>

  <p><code>Y12M</code>: Yet another matrix solver required by certain packages in trilinos and goma.</p>

  <p>The remainder of this document takes the new user step-by-step to building this large distribution, and
    ultimately building GOMA. These notes aren’t perfect.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Compilers, other libraries
      <p>
      Make sure that all the compilers and dependent libraries for building/installing are installed on your machine. Specifically, make sure gcc, cmake and openmpi are installed. Trillnos 10 requires cmake version 2.7 or higher. SEAMS requires gcc, g++ and gfortran version 4.1 or higher. Download netcdf and HDF5. Copy the HDF5 distribution to ACCESS/TPL/hdf5 directory.</p>

      <p>Some notes on acquiring these compilers and libraries:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li> cmake-2.8.10.2 package should work from the cmake website. Others above 2.7 should work too. Download it. Build and install as follows:</li>
	<ul>
	  <li><code>gunzip cmake-2.8.10.2.tar.gz</code></li>
	  <li><code>tar xvf cmake-2.8.10.2.tar</code></li>
	  <li><code>cd cmake-2.8.10.2</code></li>
	  <li><code>./configure --prefix=/home/goma&lt;full path to cmake directory&gt;/cmake-2.8.10.2</code> you can also install in /usr/bin if you have root access</li>
	  <li><code>make</code></li>
	  <li><code>make install</code></li>
	</ul>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
	<li>openmpi-1.6.3 package is also the right level right now. Acquire it and build as follows:
	  <ul>
	    <li><code>gunzip openmpi-1.6.3.tar.gz</code></li>
	    <li><code>tar –xvf openmpi-1.6.3</code></li>
	    <li><code>./configure –prefix=/home/goma/….&lt;full path to openmpi directory&gt;/openmpi-1.6.3</code>
	      (You can also install in /usr/bin, etc. if you have root access. )</li>
	    <li><code>make all install</code></li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
	<li>gcc, gfortran, g++ are likely installed in default /usr/bin and associated libraries in
/usr/local/lib or /usr/lib. If not, find where the libraries are. I.E. on a new rhel6
machine with the compilers installed in default locations, the libraries may be in
something like /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.4 or something like this.. you are
going to want these in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. See below.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
	<li>Finally, the netcdf and hdf5 libraries which are required by SEAMS and SEACAS are real
	  tricky where to place. You don’t need to build them as they are built as a part of the
	  SEACAS build script. Netcdf is discussed below. On hdf5 do the following:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Acquire hdf5 from website, viz. <code>hdf5-1.8.9.tar</code> works</li>
	    <li>place this tarball in  <code>$GOMA_ROOT/SEACAS-2012-09-10/TPL/hdf5</code></li>
	    <li>unroll it there <code>tar –xvf hdf5-1.8.9.tar</code></li>
	    <li>rename the directory <code>mv hdf5-1.8.9 hdf5-source</code></li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      ACCESS/SEAMS Build:
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Unpack the ACCESS distribution. We unroll it in the $GOMA_ROOT directory, but you can put it
	  anywhere. Note on hdf5 and netcdf as discussed above, you still place them in the TPL
	  subdirectories wherever you put SEAMS. Henceforth in this discussion ACCESSROOT will be
	  the path to the SEAMS distribution. In this example, it would be
	  <pre>

    ACCESSROOT = $GOMA_ROOT/SEACAS-2012-09-10
	  </pre>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Download netcdf. The most recent released version (currently 4.1.3) is recommended.
	  Untar the distribution in the ACCESSROOT/TPL/netcdf/ directory which already exists. You wil now
	  have a netcdf-4.1.3 directory under this netcdf directory.
	  <ul>
	    <li>If the untar does not create a netcdf-4.1.3 directory, modify the makefile in the current directory
	      such that V_NUM specifies the correct name.</li>
	    <li>Modify the following defines in include/netcdf.h
<pre>
#define NC_MAX_DIMS 65536 /* max dimensions per file */
#define NC_MAX_VARS 524288 /* max variables per file */
#define NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS 8 /* max per variable dimensions */
</pre>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	  cd back to the top-level 'seacas' subdirectory
	  <ul><li>You can also rename 'seacas' to any other name you desire.</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	  The current directory (seacas unless you renamed if) will be your ACCESS root. Set the
	  environment variable ACCESS to point to this area.
	  <ul><li><code>setenv ACCESS `pwd`</code> (csh/tcsh)</li>
		<li><code>export ACCESS=`pwd`</code> (sh/bash)</li></ul>
	  In this example, you can also simply do:
	  <pre>setenv ACCESS $GOMA_ROOT/SEACAS-2012-09-10</pre>
	  <p>
	  If you do an 'ls $ACCESS/ACCESS', you should see something similar to:
	  <pre>applications Imakefile itools libraries netcdf scripts serial_mpi</pre>
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  Move into the $ACCESS/ACCESS/itools/config/cf directory and edit the 'site.def' and the
	  configuration file associated with your platform (e.g. linux.cf for linux OS; darwin.cf for MacOS)
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <p>The 'site.def' file contains settings that determine where ACCESS is going to be installed, who
	      owns the source, and where the X11 libraries and includes files are located on your system</p>
	      <p>The following setting should be entered in the site.def file:</p>
	      <pre>#define AccessRoot - path to ACCESS source directory</pre>
	      <p>It should be the same directory path as you set as the ACCESS environment variable.</p>
	      <pre>
#define Owner owner_username
#define Group group_name</pre>
	      <p>The owner and group name of the user installing the code should be set.</p>
	      <pre>#define BuildSharedExodusLibrary YES</pre>
	      <p>Leave this set to YES unless there are problems building shared libraries on your system.</p>
	      <pre>#define UseNetcdf4 NO or YES</pre>
	      <p>Set to YES to use the new hdf5-based netcdf-4; leave as NO to use the classic netcdf-4.</p>
	      <pre>#define HDF5_Root AccessRoot</pre>
	      <p>NOTE HERE: This HDF5_Root define is LITERAL. Don’t try to outsmart it and make this the
	      path all the way down to HDF5.</p>
	      <p>If UseNetcdf4 is YES, then HDF5_Root needs to point to the root of an installed HDF5 library 
		(both libhdf5.a and libhdf5_hl.a) and include files. HDF5_Root/lib holds the libs and
	      HDF5_Root/include has the include files.</p> 
	      <blockquote><p>PRS NOTES: This is confusing. What this means is that
	      the $ACCESS/lib directory will contain libhdf6.a when it is built. Not where it is built. When
	      installed these libraries will end up in $ACCESS/bin and $ACCESS/lib</p>
	      </blockquote>
	      <pre>
#define ExcludeAnalysis
#define Parallel 0</pre>
	      <p>The above parallel setting is used for building and installing the analysis codes on parallel machines.
	      This should be set to 0 unless you are building and installing the jas3d or pronto3d analysis codes on
	      a parallel machine; in that case, it should be set to 2.</p>
	      <pre>#define Platform normal</pre>
	      <p>For most cases, leave the Platform define as "normal"; however
	      <ul>
		<li>if building on "interix", define it as interix;</li>
		<li>if building for "redstorm", define it as redstorm;</li>
	      </ul>
	      </p>
	      <pre>#define HasMatlab NO</pre>
	      <p>If the system has Matlab libraries and includes, change the definition of HasMatlab in the
	      following line from NO to YES, and check the definition of MatlabLibraries and MatlabIncludes down
	      below.</p>
	      </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>platform.cf (platform=hardware or os type) [linux.cf, darwin.cf]. The platform.cf configuration
	      file contains system-specific settings; in particular compiler paths. The linux.cf file is the most
	      complicated due to the multitude of compilers available. Pick the define corresponding to the
	      compilers you will be using and then search for that #if block and make sure paths are correct; the
	      paths typically only need changing for parallel compiles and if your system has multiple versions of
	      compilers.<p>
	      <p>In a recent fresh build on a RHEL6 machine, I chose :</p>
	      <pre>#define GCC4GFORTRAN 1</pre>
	      <p>as I planned on using the gnu compilers.</p>
	      <p>If you are building on a 64-bit system, define Build64BitAccess YES.</p>
	      <p>NOTE: If you are using a gcc version prior to 4.1, then you cannot build the fortran-based utilities for
	      64-bit systems; you must do a 32-bit build. If you are using a non-gnu compiler or using gcc-4.1.0 or later
	      (which gfortran as the fortran compiler), you can do a 64-bit build.</p>
	      <p>NOTE: If you are building on MacOS and using the Mac ports compilers, then define USE_MACPORTS as
	      the version number of the compiler (4.4, 4.5, 4.6, ...)</p>
	      <p>Before you go onto the next steps, you probably should update your environment variables through
	      your .cshrc or .bashrc startup config or from the command line to make sure all the paths are in order to
	      compilers and libraries. Specifically:</p>
	      <pre>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH &gt;full path to openmpi/lib&lt;:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
setenv PATH /usr/…fullpath to openmpi/bin:$PATH</pre>
	      <p>Of course the serial gcc, gfortran compilers should also be in your path.</p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <li>
	    <p>Use the script ACCESS/scripts/buildSEACAS, which enters the commands for you. You should be in
	    the directory specified as your AccessRoot in step 3 above. Then enter:</p>
	    <pre>sh ACCESS/scripts/buildSEACAS</pre>
	    <p>and follow the prompts. Real important here, though, to be patient and to continue with the build (by
	    entering “c” if you examine the error and deem it irrelevant. I had to do this about 4 times in some of
	    the obscure TPL libraries and SEAMS still built fine.</p>
	  </li>

	  <li><p>If you encounter the following error(s) during the build process, check to see if the corresponding
	    dependency packages are installed or simply make the fix has suggested:</p>

	    <p>netcdf.h needs to be extracted from the netcdf library under TPL/netcdf and placed into $ACCESS/inc</p>

	    <p>x11_vdix11.c:463:22: error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory – Install libX11-devel dependency
	    package. I did have to change linux.cf to point to /usr/include/X11 instead of X11R6</p>

	    <p>sudo yum whatprovides “*/Xlib.h” shows its these developer tools.</p>
	    <p>Also, NOTE, if zlib.h is not found, or libz.a then just turn OFF the #define UseNetcdf4 NO or YES in
	    site.def</p>
	    <p>An excerpt from Greg Sjaardema’s reply to an inquiry here:
	      <blockquote><p>A workaround is to change the #define UseNetcdf4 YES to NO in
		  ACCESS/itools/config/cf/site.def. This shouldn't affect too much unless
		  you are planning really big meshes (> 500 Million elements...)</p></blockquote></p>
	    <p>output.c:24:20: error: curses.h: No such file or directory – Install ncurses-devel package.</p>
	    <p>zlib.h not found – Install zlib-devel package. Also, you might need the openmpi-devel package.</p>
	  </li>
      </ol>
    <li>
      <p>Third party libraries (including Trilinos):</p>
      <p>First, read the user's guide section in Readme.libs. The only modifications that should need to be
	made if mpi or gcc compilers are used should be in make.inc.</p>
      <p>You will try to build these first using the overall makefile in the top level directory. This makefile
	guides the building of every package but SEACAS. It tends to choke on trilinos, so you may need to
	build that individually.</p>
      <p>Only after modifying make.inc, where you set the compiler locations and the cmake locations, you
	can try running make.</p>
      <pre>make</pre>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p><code>make help</code> gives a good basic summary of the commands enabled within the TPL makefile.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>You will need to deal with some smallish errors as the packages are being built. Look in
	  make_output directory for the error descriptions. For instance, I had to deal with the
	  following most recently:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><p>ARPACK: I had to go grab mpif.h from the openmpi/include directory and put it into
		the directory instructed by ARmake.inc<p></li>
	    <li>Other minor annoyances I had to track down and fix.</li>
	    <li>Ultimately, this script will hang on the trilinos build. To build trilinos individually, do
	      the following:</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Go to a scratch area on your machine. /scratch or someplace where there is
		plenty of disk space.</li>
	      <li>Make a build directory for trilinos there, like mkdir trilinos_build</li>
	      <li>cd trilinos_build</li>
	      <li>cp $GOMA_ROOT/Key-linux-mpi-cmake-script .</li>
	      <li>Modify all of the library locations as necessary in
		this script.
		Specifally pay attention to the
		fortran library. It worked better when I just set
		this directly to the library path:</li>
	      <pre>FORTRAN_LIBS=”/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64_linux_/4.4.4/libgfortran.a”</pre>
	      <li>Make sure all other cmake directives are pointing to
		the correct libraries. They may be a lot of them.</li>
	      
	      <pre>
sh key-linux-mpi-cmake-script
make (this takes about 2 hours)
make install</pre>
	      
	      <p>note that you may want to rerun the linux script if
	      libraries are updated/changed. Reissuing a make just
	      picks up where it left off.
	      Also, if an error is
	      persistent in the cmake step, blow away the entire
	      build directory and create a new one and start over
	      with the updated script.</p>

	      <li> Ignore this error:</li>
	      <pre>rm: cannot remove `CMakeCache.txt': No such file or directory</pre>

	    </ul>
	    <p>There were a couple headers files (umfpack.h and amd.h) that were missing from the amesos
	      source directory which prevented amesos from building. I had copy them over from the UMFPACK
	      and AMD directories.</p>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	</ul>

	<li><p>brk/fix:</p>
	  <p>Check the following macros before doing a make.</p>
	  <pre>
CC
ACCESS
COPTIMIZEFLAGS</pre>
	  <p>Brk/fix compiled without any major issues.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
	  GOMA:
	  <p>After the suitable makefile is chosen, read through the makefile itself to find the macros that need
	    changing. Common macros include:</p>
	  <pre>MACH, ARCH, GOMA_LIBS, MPI_TOP, GCC_TOP, SEAMS_DIR, TRILINOS_ARCH</pre>
	  <p>After making sure that the paths are set correctly, run:</p>
	  <pre>make -f Makefile_***</pre>
	  <p>I did not run into any issues with building goma. Just make sure all the paths are pointed to the correct
	    compilers and the libraries.</p>
	</li>
    </ol>
