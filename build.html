</div>

<p>This document takes the new user step-by-step to building this large distribution, and
ultimately building GOMA.</p>
<p>This is a guide to build Goma 6.0 if you have no root access, and you want 
to build a self-contained distribution from which GOMA and all its dependencies
can be built. This build guide was constructed on Red Hat   RHEL5 and Red Hat 
RHEL6 OS. Although  many of the tips might apply to other platforms, there are no
promises.</p>

</div>

<h3>Download Directories and TPLs</h3>
<p>First you need to acquire the GOMA software distribution.</p>
<p>If you don’t have root access, and your machine has on it cmake and openmpi, then you will not need
those two libraries. Cmake is rarer than Openmpi, but in any case you want to determine whether you
have these. Cmake is used to build trilinos. Openmpi is required for all packages if you are to build 
for parallel capability. In this build guide, we started without Cmake and Openmpi.</p>

<p>If you have root access, and you are building on a server of some sort, you may want to acquire Cmake
and Openmpi and build and install in the usual default locations, like /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib etc., or
even in /usr/bin for the executables. You may also have a shared area to build these tools in. You can
also just simply work with your administrator to acquire these packages.</p>
<h4>Download</h4>
<p>Here are the directories (distributions) and TPLs (third-party libraries) that are required. A brief
description of each and how they can be acquired is given here.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure that all the compilers and dependent libraries for building/installing are installed on your machine. Specifically, make sure gcc, cmake and openmpi are installed. Trillnos 10 requires cmake version 2.7 or higher. SEAMS requires gcc, g++ and gfortran version 4.1 or higher. Download netcdf and HDF5. Copy the HDF5 distribution to ACCESS/TPL/hdf5 directory.</p>

<p>Now that you have extracted all of the downloaded files, your directories and files should look like this in your “GOMA_ROOT” area:</p>
<div class="highlight">

<pre> <code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">

<h3> Build the Libraries</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Compilers, other libraries</h4>

<p>Some notes on acquiring these compilers and libraries:</p>

<ul>
	<li> cmake-2.8.12.2 package should work from the cmake website. Others above 2.7 should work too. Build and install as follows:</li>
<ul>

<li><code id="libraries">cd cmake-2.8.10.2</code></li>
<li><code id="libraries">./bootstrap --prefix=/home/goma&lt;full path to cmake directory&gt;/cmake-2.8.10.2</code> you can also install in /usr/bin if you have root access</li>
<li><code id="libraries">make</code></li>
<li><code id="libraries">make install</code></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>openmpi-1.6.4 package is also the right level right now. Build as follows:
<ul>
<li><code id="libraries">cd openmpi-1.6.4</code></li>
<li><code id="libraries">./configure --prefix=/home/goma/….&lt;full path to openmpi directory&gt;/openmpi-1.6.4</code>
(You can also install in /usr/bin, etc. if you have root access. )</li>
<li><code id="libraries">make</code></li>
<li><code id="libraries">make install</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>gcc, gfortran, g++ are likely installed in default /usr/bin and associated libraries in
/usr/local/lib or /usr/lib. If not, find where the libraries are. I.E. on a new rhel6
machine with the compilers installed in default locations, the libraries may be in
something like /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.4 or something like this.. you are
going to want these in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. See below.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<h4> ACCESS/SEACAS/SEAMS Build:</h4>
</li>

<p>
In this discussion ACCESSROOT will be
the path to the SEAMS distribution. In this example, it would be
<pre>

ACCESSROOT = $GOMA_ROOT/SEACAS-2013-12-03
</pre>
</p>
<ol>
<h5>
Building your ACCESSROOT: 
</h5>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Modify the following defines in Seacas-2013-12-03/TPL/netcdf/netcdf-4.3.2/include/netcdf.h
<pre>
#define NC_MAX_DIMS 65536 /* max dimensions per file */
#define NC_MAX_VARS 524288 /* max variables per file */
#define NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS 8 /* max per variable dimensions */
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
cd back to the top-level Seacas-2013-12-03 subdirectory
</li>
<li>
The current directory Seacas-2013-12-03 will be your ACCESS root. Set the
environment variable ACCESS to point to this area.
<ul><li><code id="libraries">setenv ACCESS `pwd`</code> (csh/tcsh)</li>
<li><code id="libraries">export ACCESS=`pwd`</code> (sh/bash)</li></ul>
In this example, you can also simply do:
<pre>setenv ACCESS $GOMA_ROOT/SEACAS-2013-12-03</pre>
<p>
If you do an 'ls $ACCESS/ACCESS', you should see something similar to:
<pre>applications Imakefile itools libraries netcdf scripts serial_mpi</pre>
</p>
</li>

<li>
Move into the $ACCESS/ACCESS/itools/config/cf directory and edit the 'site.def' and the
configuration file associated with your platform (e.g. linux.cf for linux OS; darwin.cf for MacOS)
<ol>
<li>
<p>The 'site.def' file contains settings that determine where ACCESS is going to be installed, who
owns the source, and where the X11 libraries and includes files are located on your system</p>
<p>The following setting should be entered in the site.def file:</p>
<pre>#define AccessRoot - path to ACCESS source directory</pre>
<p>It should be the same directory path as you set as the ACCESS environment variable.</p>
<pre>
#define Owner owner_username
#define Group group_name</pre>
<p>The owner and group name of the user installing the code should be set.</p>
<pre>#define BuildSharedExodusLibrary YES</pre>
<p>Leave this set to YES unless there are problems building shared libraries on your system.</p>
<pre>#define UseNetcdf4 NO or YES</pre>
<p>Set to YES to use the new hdf5-based netcdf-4; leave as NO to use the classic netcdf-4.</p>
<pre>#define HDF5_Root AccessRoot</pre>
<p>NOTE HERE: This HDF5_Root define is LITERAL. Don’t try to outsmart it and make this the
path all the way down to HDF5.</p>
<p>If UseNetcdf4 is YES, then HDF5_Root needs to point to the root of an installed HDF5 library 
(both libhdf5.a and libhdf5_hl.a) and include files. HDF5_Root/lib holds the libs and
HDF5_Root/include has the include files.</p> 
<p>PRS NOTES: This is confusing. What this means is that
the $ACCESS/lib directory will contain libhdf6.a when it is built. Not where it is built. When
installed these libraries will end up in $ACCESS/bin and $ACCESS/lib</p>

<pre>
#define ExcludeAnalysis
#define Parallel 0</pre>
<p>The above parallel setting is used for building and installing the analysis codes on parallel machines.
This should be set to 0 unless you are building and installing the jas3d or pronto3d analysis codes on
a parallel machine; in that case, it should be set to 2.</p>
<pre>#define Platform normal</pre>
<p>For most cases, leave the Platform define as "normal"; however
<ul>
<li>if building on "interix", define it as interix;</li>
<li>if building for "redstorm", define it as redstorm;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<pre>#define HasMatlab NO</pre>
<p>If the system has Matlab libraries and includes, change the definition of HasMatlab in the
following line from NO to YES, and check the definition of MatlabLibraries and MatlabIncludes down
below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>next edit your platform.cf in the same cf directory(platform=hardware or os type) [linux.cf, darwin.cf]. The platform.cf configuration
file contains system-specific settings; in particular compiler paths. The linux.cf file is the most
complicated due to the multitude of compilers available. Pick the define corresponding to the
compilers you will be using and then search for that #if block and make sure paths are correct; the
paths typically only need changing for parallel compiles and if your system has multiple versions of
compilers.<p>
<p>In a recent fresh build on a RHEL6 machine, I chose :</p>
<pre>#define GCC4GFORTRAN 1</pre>
<p>I also edited the #define X11Includes from:</p>
<pre>#define X11Includes -I/usr/include/X11R6</pre>
<p>To:</p>
<pre>#define X11Includes -I/usr/include/X11</pre>
<p>as I planned on using the gnu compilers.</p>
<p>If you are building on a 64-bit system, define Build64BitAccess YES.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you are using a gcc version prior to 4.1, then you cannot build the fortran-based utilities for
64-bit systems; you must do a 32-bit build. If you are using a non-gnu compiler or using gcc-4.1.0 or later
(which gfortran as the fortran compiler), you can do a 64-bit build.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you are building on MacOS and using the Mac ports compilers, then define USE_MACPORTS as
the version number of the compiler (4.4, 4.5, 4.6, ...)</p>
<p>Before you go onto the next steps, you probably should update your environment variables through
your .cshrc or .bashrc startup config or from the command line to make sure all the paths are in order to
compilers and libraries. Specifically:</p>
<pre>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH &gt;full path to openmpi/lib&lt;:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
setenv PATH /usr/…fullpath to openmpi/bin:$PATH</pre>
<p>Of course the serial gcc, gfortran compilers should also be in your path.</p>
</li>

<h4>IMPORTANT: go into netcdf and hdf5 Makefiles and make sure that the version number is correct to the versions you downloaded</h4>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Use the script ACCESS/scripts/buildSEACAS, which enters the commands for you. You should be in
the directory specified as your AccessRoot in step 3 above. Then enter:</p>
<pre>sh ACCESS/scripts/buildSEACAS</pre>
<p>and follow the prompts. Real important here, though, to be patient and to continue with the build (by
entering “c” if you examine the error and deem it irrelevant. I had to do this about 4 times in some of
the obscure TPL libraries and SEAMS still built fine.</p>
</li>

<li><p>If you encounter the following error(s) during the build process, check to see if the corresponding
dependency packages are installed or simply make the fix has suggested:</p>

<p>netcdf.h needs to be extracted from the netcdf library under TPL/netcdf and placed into $ACCESS/inc</p>

<p>x11_vdix11.c:463:22: error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory – Install libX11-devel dependency
package. I did have to change linux.cf to point to /usr/include/X11 instead of X11R6</p>

<p>sudo yum whatprovides “*/Xlib.h” shows its these developer tools.</p>
<p>Also, NOTE, if zlib.h is not found, or libz.a then just turn OFF the #define UseNetcdf4 NO or YES in
site.def</p>
<p>An excerpt from Greg Sjaardema’s reply to an inquiry here:
<blockquote><p>A workaround is to change the #define UseNetcdf4 YES to NO in
ACCESS/itools/config/cf/site.def. This shouldn't affect too much unless
you are planning really big meshes (> 500 Million elements...)</p></blockquote></p>
<p>output.c:24:20: error: curses.h: No such file or directory – Install ncurses-devel package.</p>
<p>zlib.h not found – Install zlib-devel package. Also, you might need the openmpi-devel package.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<li>
<h4>Third party libraries (including Trilinos):</h4>
<p>First, read the user's guide section in Readme.libs. The only modifications that should need to be
made if mpi or gcc compilers are used should be in make.inc.</p>
<p>You will try to build these first using the overall makefile in the top level directory. This makefile
guides the building of every package but SEACAS. It tends to choke on trilinos, so you may need to
build that individually.</p>
<p>Only after modifying make.inc, where you set the compiler locations and the cmake locations, you
can try running make.</p>
<pre>make</pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code id="libraries">make help</code> gives a good basic summary of the commands enabled within the TPL makefile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need to deal with some smallish errors as the packages are being built. Look in
make_output directory for the error descriptions. </p>
<ul>
<li>Make the BLAS library.
<ul>
<li><code id="libraries">cd BLAS</code></li>

<li>Make ARPACK library. Build as follows:
<ul>
<li><code id="libraries">cd ARPACK</code></li>
<li>Edit the ARmake.inc file</li>
<li>Inside the ARmake.inc file edit the home function to resemble where you untared your ARPACK and change your flags</li>
<li>For us, we changed home to <code id="libraries">$(HOME)/GOMA_ROOT/ARPACK</code></li>
<li>We then changed FC to equal f95</li>
<li>go back to the ARPACK dir and issue the command:<code id="libraries">make all</code></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Make SuperLU library. Build as follows:
<ul>
<li><code id="libraries">cd SuperLU_DIST_2.3</code></li>
<li>Edit the make.inc file</li>
<li>Inside the make.inc file set PLAT equal to nothing, edit the DSuperLUroot, edit the BLASLIB, edit the METISLIB and PARMETISLIB, set ARCHFLAGS to -rc, set RANLIB to echo, set CC to mpicc set FORTRAN to mpif90, LOADER to mpicc, and edit CDEFS to equal -Dadd_. </li>
<li>Go to the ARPACK dir and issue the command:<code id="libraries">make</code></li>
<li>Go back inside the make.inc file and delete any unrecognized flags. </li>
<li>Run: <code id="libraries">make</code></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Make lapack library. Build as follows:
<ul>
<li><code id="libraries">cd lapack-3.2.1</code></li>
<li>make the make.inc.example into a make.inc</li>
<li>edit the BLASLIB in the new make.inc to find your BLAS lib.a</li>
<li>For us, we changed BLASLIB to $(home)/GOMA_ROOT/BLAS/blas_LINUX.a</code></li>
<li>in lapack-3.2.1 run:<code id="libraries">make</code></li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>Make the sparse library.
<ul>
<li><code id="libraries">cd sparse/src</code></li>
<li><code id="libraries">make</code></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Make the UMFPACK library.
<ul>
<li>cd to UF config and edit the UFconfig.mk file</li>
<li>Inside the UFconfig.mk file add AR and ARFLAGS between RANLIB and ARCHIVE. Then make AR, ARFLAGS, and ARCHIVE equal ar cr. Then set the BLAS and LAPACK to find the correct BLAS and lapack libraries. Set the UMFPACK_CONFIG equal to -DNCHOLMOD.</li>
<li>cd into UMFPACK and run: <code id="libraries">make</code></li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>Make the Trilinos library.
<ul>
<li>Get the trilinos build key from our website and move it into the trilinos-11.8.1-Source file.</li>
<li>Make a new directory named trilinos-11.8.1-&lt;trilinos build name&gt;</li>
<li>cd into trilinos-11.8.1-&lt;trilinos build name&gt; and run: <code id="libraries">../trilinos-11.8.1-Source/Key</code></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3>Build Goma</h3>


<!--	WORK HERE!!!	WORK HERE!!!	WORK HERE!!! -->	

<li>
GOMA:
<ul>
<li>Go to the GitHub page goma/goma.</li>
<li>make a directory seprate from your GOMA_ROOT to build Goma.</li>
<li>Copy the HTTPS clone URL on the right hand side of the page, then cd into your new Goma directory and run <code id="libraries">git clone <Goma URL></code></li>
</ul>
<p>After the suitable makefile is chosen, read through the makefile itself to find the macros that need
changing. Common macros include:</p>
<pre>MACH, ARCH, GOMA_LIBS, MPI_TOP, GCC_TOP, SEAMS_DIR, TRILINOS_ARCH</pre>
<p>After making sure that the paths are set correctly, run:</p>
